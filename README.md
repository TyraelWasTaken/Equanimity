# Equanimity
## Equanimity is a 65%, gasket mounted, alice style keyboard with a knob.

There were no design goals for the project, it was simply what I wanted to see in a keyboard.

It is fully Open-Source, all files I have used to make my own I have published for everyone else to enjoy.

Firmware wise, the qmk build *should* be functional, and I am actively working on trying to publish a successful via build.

Equanimity uses cherry switches with kailh hotswap sockets, and the standard EC11 (although an EC12 should work just fine).
Also, the project uses a C series unified daughterboard with JST connectors.

The "symbol" for the equanimity is a water lily.

If you wish to build this or have any inquiries please contact me via discord and I will help you with the project.
